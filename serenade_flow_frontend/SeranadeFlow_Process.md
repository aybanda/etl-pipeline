# SerenadeFlow ETL Process

## 1. Extraction

- Data is currently extracted from a placeholder source.
- Future implementations will include multiple data sources.

## 2. Transformation

- Data undergoes a simple transformation (multiplication by 2).
- Future implementations will include more complex transformations based on business logic.

## 3. Loading

- Transformed data is currently printed to the console.
- Future implementations will load data into a specified database or data warehouse.

## 4. Error Handling

- The ETL process is wrapped in a try-except block to catch and report any errors.
- Errors are returned through the GraphQL API.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

- The current implementation uses basic print statements for logging.
- Future implementations will include more robust logging and monitoring solutions.

## 6. Execution

- The ETL process can be triggered through the GraphQL API.
- The frontend provides a button to initiate the ETL process.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement real data sources and sinks.
- Add more complex transformation logic.
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- Add scheduling capabilities for automated ETL runs.
- Implement performance optimizations for large datasets.
- Add security measures to protect sensitive data.
